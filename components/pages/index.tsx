								This platform is being piloted for real time pathogen genomics data management,
								sharing and exchange in Africa. The platform allows users to upload, share, explore,
								and download pathogen sequence and associated metadata as per data use guidelines
								provided by each country. The data contained in this platform is shared by Member
								States and made available by the Africa CDC. Africa CDCâ€™s goal is to deliver a
								highly secured, trusted, public health oriented and seamless solution to facilitate
								the real-time sharing of pathogen sequence data.

									<Paragraph>
										The Agari pilot development and implementation is based on the CanCoGen VirusSeq
										data portal, developed at the Ontario Institute of Cancer Research (OICR). The
										Agari platform provides its services on a Kubernetes cluster. The landing page
										allows the public to see summary information of what is in the data portal.
									</Paragraph>
									<Paragraph>
										A registration button facilitates authorisation and authentication. Registered
										users can upload NGS data and associated metadata. The metadata is indexed and
										allows rapid customised query searches. Dashboards are used to provide visual
										summaries of datasets and provenance information.
									</Paragraph>
								</div>
								<div style={{ width: '45%' }}>
									<Title level={3}>How to use this platform </Title>
									<Paragraph>
										There is adequate information on the landing page that can be accessed without
										the need to register for an account. The navigation panel to the left provides
										quick access to information about the portal. The registration link provides
										users with a mechanism to request an account. Registered users can upload
										within-country generated datasets and associated metadata, download datasets,
										browse metadata and have access to a record of previous activity on the portal.
